# Class-C-power-amplifier-in-CMOS-tech

A power amplifier is a final block in the transmission path of a transceiver. It amplifies a signal to high power that ensures a transmitted signal to propagate across some distance and be received at the receiver end. Power amplifiers are used at different places which have a lot of applications.
Using CMOS technology here reduces cost, hence it is used in building many integrated systems. It is also better than other options when it comes to large scale integration. The efficiency of class-C power amplifier varies from 50% to 85%.
Here, Class-C PA design is discussed along with the actual implementation using CMOS technology within the Cadence software. It consumes low power and improves the efficiency of the wireless communications.

Designing a Class-C Power Amplifier(PA) at 865MHz frequency.
• High efficiency.
• Low physical size for given Power output.
• FM transmitters
